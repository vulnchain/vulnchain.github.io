      <p>We precisely locate possible cyberattack vectors and ruthlessly eliminate them.</p>
      <p>Devices and services that contribute to the digital ecosystems of the Internet of Things have become a permanent element in every sphere of everyday life and business. Today, they are an inseparable part of our homes, office spaces, management offices and production lines, blurring the boundaries between the digital and physical world.</p>
      <p>Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of the existence of devices that can connect to the network, collect information, and exchange it with each other. They operate on the basis of modules such as transmitters and light, heat and motion sensors. The data they transmit can be reused by other elements of the infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The Internet of Things is an unprecedented phenomenon. Its scale reveals to those who implement it new and unknown challenges and difficulties in terms of information security. To efficiently detect and prevent cyberthreats, it is necessary to involve cybersecurity experts.</p>
      <p>Each newly manufactured technological product that enters the market is equipped with advanced electronics, enabling it to exchange information with its surroundings. The fact that its pre-built modules are equipped with micro- and nano-electronic elements makes it directly exposed to the intruders who may try to take control over it.</p>
      <p>As a result of the mass connection of vulnerable Internet of Things devices to the network, justified concerns arise around their methods of communication and information exchange with the environment. Those concerns are proved right in face of common abuses which happen every day.</p>
      <p>These abuses concern the actual level of security of software & hardware solutions that perform real-time functions such as generating, aggregating and processing data in the Internet of Things environments.</p>
      <p>Not updated, improperly configured and managed physical modules (transmitters and micro transmitters – beacons, sensors, cameras, remote control systems and receivers) become vulnerable to the whole spectrum of malicious activities from attackers, opening possibilities for the interception, exfiltration and misuse of confidential data.</p>
      <p>Additional doubts are raised by the fact that many manufacturers use pre-encrypted credentials, such as voice and video recordings, information on our health parameters, heart rate and sleep, and GPS-based records of our location, etc. Many intruders understand them as a direct invitation to attack.</p>

                <p>At VULNCHAIN, as part of constantly developed solutions, we focus on accurate and precise localization of probable cyberattack vectors so that they can be captured and eliminated as quickly as possible. This strategy, combined with our focus on delivering the best end-result, allows our clients to effectively avoid a whole range of unpleasant events.</p>
                <p>VULNCHAIN experts verify solutions designed with the use of Internet of Things devices. We have many years of experience in identifying weaknesses in systems and analyzing potential attacks on this type of devices. The key effect of our work are recommendations that, after their implementation, will help protect users against information leaks and loss of control over devices.</p>
